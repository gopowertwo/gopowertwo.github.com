*** Rooting Nexus 4 ***

So, I decided to root my Nexus 4, which I also use as everyday mobile phone. While I was thinking about doing that for quite long, finally I had to do it because I needed to be able to capture network traffic. Fortunately for me, CyanogenMod team had released an installer which allows to intall CyanogenMod with few clicks. However, it required Windows Vista/7/8 to run the PC part of the installer, and I have been using Linux only for the last 5 years. Again fortunately for me, I had a copy of Windows 7 with a key,which I promptly installed on VirtualBox.
